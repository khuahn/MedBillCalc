### What's New in MedBillCalc v2.1 âœ¨
Streamlined the entire app to make it faster and easier for you to use. This new version brings major improvements across the board, from how the calculations work to the overall look and feel.

### Key Highlights ðŸš€
Installable App & Wider Compatibility: You can now install MedBillCalc directly from your browser to use it offline. The app is fully responsive on all modern devices (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile) and is compatible with Chrome 70+, Firefox 65+, Safari 12+, and Edge 79+. It requires JavaScript and localStorage to be enabled for full functionality.

**Smarter Calculations:** The calculator can now automatically figure out missing values, whether you're looking for payments, adjustments, or the final balance. It's more intelligent and fixes previous issues with circular calculations.

**Cleaner Design:** Simplified the interface with a single-row start, streamlined buttons, and new copy icons for a cleaner look. We also enhanced the design with smoother edges and consistent styling for a more polished feel.

**Better Mobile Experience:** The app is now fully optimized for mobile devices with a horizontal button layout, larger touch targets, and improved responsiveness. It even prevents unwanted zooming on iOS.

**Improved Printing**: Get professional, clean printouts every time. The app now always prints in light mode, hides unnecessary controls, and formats inputs as plain text for a perfect, professional document.

Bug Fixes & Speed: Squashed several bugs and made key technical improvements to make the app more stable, efficient, and reliable.
